# untitled-gms2-platformer
A game worked on by me and a friend around 2 years ago. Made in gamemaker studio 2. My friend managed the design and spritework of the game, while I programmed it with some suggestive feedback and ideas from both of us. It turned out pretty well for a fun little side project.

# Controls
Move with the arrow keys.

Jump with the Z button.

Dash with the C button.(only works while moving)

Pick up weapons with the X button.

Switch weapon mode with the V button.(only the ice gun has 2 modes)

# Note
the ice gun has 2 modes. One with low damage, high fire rate and a freezing effect, the other with high damage, low fire rate, and a bullet that attaches to walls and becomes a platform to step on for a brief period, making it useful for puzzles.
